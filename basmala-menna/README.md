# Application of QML to Identify Malicious Login Attempts Based on BETH Dataset
The group members of this project are Basmala Sallam and Menna Zaied, mentored by Mr Jannes Stubbemann. This is part of the competition set by aqora where BETH dataset is utilized for suspicious login detection. 
# What is BETH dataset?
BETH Dataset an open-source collection of high-quality cybersecurity data specifically curated for anomaly detection research. This rich dataset provides a realistic foundation for developing and testing innovative approaches to cybersecurity challenges.
# What is VQC? and why did we choose it?
The variational quantum classifiers (VQC) are quantum circuits that can be trained from labeled data to classify new data samples. A variational circuit can be optimized to emulate the parity function:
\begin{align}
f: x \in \{0,1\}^{\otimes n} \rightarrow y =
\begin{cases} 1 \text{  if uneven number of 1's in } x \\ 0
\text{ else}. 
\end{cases}
\end{align}
